Q-8. In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?
ANS:
CSS can be integrated into a web page in three different ways:
1. 
Inline CSS: Styles are applied directly within the HTML elements using the style attribute. 
Each HTML tag can have its own style attribute, which affects only that specific element.
2. 
Internal CSS: Styles are placed inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of the HTML document. 
This method applies styles to elements on a single page.
3. 
External CSS: Styles are defined in a separate .css file which is linked to the HTML document using a 
<link> tag in the <head> section. This is the most efficient way to apply styles when the same styles 
are to be applied to multiple pages.
